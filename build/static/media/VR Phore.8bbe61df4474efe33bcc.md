# Abstract

Binocular anomalies are prevalent among individuals, particularly children, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Traditional diagnostic tools like the synoptophore, while effective, pose challenges due to cost and specialized training requirements, particularly for smaller clinics in rural areas like those in India. In this study, we introduce a novel VR-based diagnostic system, VR-Phore, designed to diagnose binocular anomalies using similar criteria to the synoptophore. We compared data obtained from both the synoptophore and VR-Phore to assess binocular anomalies in children aged 6-15 years, demonstrating the potential of VR-Phore as an accessible and effective alternative for diagnosing these visual conditions.
