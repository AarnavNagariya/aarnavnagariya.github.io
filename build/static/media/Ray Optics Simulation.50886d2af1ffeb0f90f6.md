## Overview
The **Ray Optics Simulation** project is a powerful educational tool designed to help students grasp complex optical concepts with ease. By providing an interactive and visual approach, the simulation enables learners to explore the behavior of light as it interacts with various optical elements, such as mirrors and lenses. Built using the Unity engine, this tool bridges the gap between theoretical learning and practical understanding.

## Features
The following features are either implemented or planned to enhance the simulation's functionality and user experience:

### Core Functionalities
- **Single Laser Operation**
  - Supports one laser beam at a time for accurate ray tracing.
  - Handles refraction by dynamically adjusting refractive indices for surfaces.
  - Workaround for multiple lasers is under consideration to prevent incorrect refractive index assignments.

- **Basic Controls**
  - **Left Mouse Button**: Move optical objects.
  - **Right Mouse Button**: Access object properties.
  - **Middle Mouse Button**: Rotate objects.

### Advanced Features (In Progress)
- **Visual Enhancements**
  - Improve aesthetics to resemble a professional optics setup.
  - Add pop-up boxes for better UI feedback.

- **Customizable Options**
  - Integrate a color picker for the laser emitter.
  - Develop models for spherical mirrors and lenses.

- **Physics Simulation**
  - Implement dispersion using Cauchyâ€™s equation and simulate chromatic effects.
  - Add support for Total Internal Reflection (TIR).

- **Camera Controls**
  - Enable movable and clamped camera for flexible viewing angles.
  - Integrate collision detection with walls for realistic navigation.

- **Modular Design**
  - Create separate scenes for:
    - Reflection
    - Refraction (with preset refractive indices)
    - Dispersion

### User Interface (UI) Enhancements
- Add an intuitive start menu and tutorial text.
- Enable manual adjustment of object properties via an object menu.
- Improve the object addition menu with better visuals and descriptive text.
- Provide hover-over information for optical objects, including names and refractive indices.

### Annotation Features
- Add precise annotations for:
  - Measuring distances.
  - Measuring angles using a virtual protractor.

## Future Goals
The project aims to evolve into a comprehensive simulation tool that can be widely adopted in educational settings. By continuously improving the features and user interface, this tool will offer an immersive learning experience for students studying optics.
